* When was the company incorporated? June 16, 1911

* Who are the founders of the company? Charles Ranlett Flint

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? It was formed from three different companies, the Computing Scale Company, the Tabulating Machine Company, and the Time Recording Company. Thus yielding IBM's original name of C-T-R Company. Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? It is a publicly traded company that receives revenue from many different sources including hardware (mainframe) sales, consulting and contracts.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? Currently the major focus of IBM is to sell watsonx to it's clients. Watsonx aims to provide an AI platform for business and enterprise use, prioritizing governance, security and AI ethics.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? Any and all businesses and enterprises globally. There is no definitive number but the estimates of the market potential have been quoted from CEO Arvind Krishna to be in the billions. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) The upper hand that IBM has is that they have one of the most comprehensive portfolios of enterprise AI solutions available. Watsonx "offers users advanced machine learning, data management and generative AI capabilities to train, validate, tune and deploy AI systems accross the business with speed, trusted data and governance." - https://www.ibm.com/blog/introducing-watsonx-the-future-of-ai-for-business/

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) "The core components include: a studio for new foundation models, generative AI and machine learning; a fit-for-purpose data store built on an open data lakehouse architecture; and a toolkit, to accelerate AI workflows that are built with responsibility, transparency and explainability." - https://www.ibm.com/watsonx#:~:text=The%20core%20components%20include%3A%20a,Why%20watsonx%3F

## Landscape

* What field is the company in? Enterprise AI and Hybrid Cloud

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years? "In the last five years, the field of AI has made major progress in almost all its standard sub-areas, including vision, speech recognition and generation, natural language processing (understanding and generation), image and video generation, multi-agent systems, planning, decision-making, and integration of vision and motor control for robotics. In addition, breakthrough applications emerged in a variety of domains including games, medical diagnosis, logistics systems, autonomous driving, language translation, and interactive personal assistance." - Stanford University 
* Innovations include generative adversarial networks or GANs, GANs are the forefront of generative AI allowing AI to create original content. 

* What are the other major companies in this field? Microsoft, Amazon, and Google

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? IBM's Watson suite has been deployed to over 100 million companies across 20 industries. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics? SMART goals for the business success. For technology success you would use things like accuracy, F1-score, ROC curve, AUC, recall, MAE, MSE, RMSE, NPS and ROI. Currently there are no solid metrics published for watsonx due to it's infancy. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field? IBM is at our above most of their competitors in the area of AI. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) I would suggest that the company tap into the everyday consumer space to further drive revenue and open AI solutioning progress. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? I believe this would drive the companies popularity and allow them to tap into ALL of the AI industries and use cases available. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? They would need to tap into Large Language Models and Natural Language Processing along with generative AI in order to be a big competitor in the market. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? They are appropriate because they will be a benefit to the consumer and the client that it would target.
